;; Description:
;; Wicd (https://launchpad.net/wicd), is a popular network
;; communication manager for linux. It is composed of a daemon
;; running as root and of clients running as unprivileged users
;; daemon and clients communicate by the D-Bus 
;; (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus) message bus
;; system. This file implements a Wicd client for Emacs using
;; the D-Bus binding for Emacs Lisp.

;; Compatibility: GNU Emacs with D-Bus binding (version 23 or higher)

;;; Code:

(require 'dbus)
